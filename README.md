# Blockchain
This repository contains the golang code of a simple blockchain implementation.

This blockchain consists of three parts:

A simple wallet that you can get address, scan utxos, sign transaction.
A simple blockchain can sync block from other known nodes, mining new block, send transaction and broadcast to other node.
A simple restful server you can query blocks and utxos from blockchain.
There are many part are not like real blockchain because it's just simple implementation, still insecure and incomplete. you can learn the basic operation of the blockchain through this project.
